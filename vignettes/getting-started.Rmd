# Getting Started with _quanyu_

The **quanyu** package was created for *ETC5523 Assignment 4* to demonstrate how to bundle a dataset and a Shiny app into an R package.  
It allows users to explore how **Fire Weather Index (FWI)** relates to **burned area** in bushfire events.

## üî• What this package does

The package provides:
- A dataset `se_fire_monthly` summarising monthly fire weather and burned area.
- A Shiny app (`run_app()`) that lets users interactively explore how FWI affects burned area.

This helps users visually understand whether higher fire danger (FWI) corresponds to larger burned areas ‚Äî and how this relationship changes by month.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Load the package

```r
library(quanyu)
```


## üîç View the dataset
```r

head(se_fire_monthly)

```

The dataset includes:

- **month** ‚Äì Month of observation  
- **FWI** ‚Äì *Fire Weather Index* (higher = more dangerous fire conditions)  
- **burned_area** ‚Äì *Area burned in hectares* (the plot uses `log10(burned_area)`)


## üöÄ Launch the Shiny app
```r
run_app()

```
**App features:**

- **Slider:** Filter by minimum FWI (to focus on high-risk conditions)
- **Dropdown:** Select a month to see seasonal patterns
- **Checkbox:** Show or hide the trend line


## Interpreting the interactive results
The following section explains how to interpret the interactive outputs from the Bushfire Explorer app and why the patterns matter in practice.


### Interpretation and Real-world Implications

The *Bushfire Explorer* app provides an interactive way to explore how the **Fire Weather Index (FWI)** relates to **burned area size**, and how this relationship changes under different conditions.

### 1. Observed patterns
In general, the data show that larger burned areas often occur under higher FWI values, indicating that **extreme fire weather tends to amplify fire impact**.  
However, when the FWI threshold is set very high (e.g., above 50), the number of observations becomes small, and the correlation may weaken or even turn negative.  
This reflects **the natural variability of fire events** ‚Äî at extreme weather levels, other factors (such as vegetation type, fuel availability, or firefighting response) can dominate the outcome.

### 2. Practical insight
This variability highlights why **interactive filtering** is important:  
users can adjust thresholds to observe how relationships change across conditions, months, or sample sizes.  
For emergency planners, this means that **relying on a single static model could be misleading**; instead, dynamic exploration can reveal when FWI is a strong predictor and when it is not.

### 3. Seasonal differences
By selecting months, users can see that the FWI‚Äìburned area relationship fluctuates seasonally.  
For example, in drier months, even moderate FWI levels can result in large burned areas, whereas in wetter months, the effect may flatten out.  
This suggests that **fire risk management strategies should be tailored to seasonal and regional contexts**.

### 4. Conclusion
The Bushfire Explorer demonstrates how combining **data visualization** and **interactive filtering** helps translate raw climate indicators into nuanced, actionable insights.  
Instead of offering a single conclusion, the app encourages **exploratory reasoning**, showing that relationships between weather and fire impact are conditional and context-dependent.
