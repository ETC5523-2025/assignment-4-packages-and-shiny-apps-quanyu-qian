# quanyu

**quanyu** is an R package developed for **ETC5523 Assignment 4**.  
It provides a small demo dataset and a Shiny app that allows users to interactively explore the relationship between **Fire Weather Index (FWI)** and **burned area** across months.

Note: The dataset se_fire_monthly is simulated for demonstration in ETC5523 Assignment 4 (see data-raw/make_data.R). It is not real-world measurements.

## 🧠 Background
This package builds upon earlier ETC5523 assignments where ERA5 and MODIS data were used to study bushfire conditions.
For this assignment, a simplified and synthetic dataset `se_fire_monthly` (100 observations) was created to demonstrate the link between FWI and burned area.
The dataset was generated using the R script `data-raw/make_data.R`, ensuring reproducibility.


## 🧩 Installation

This is a demonstration package created for ETC5523 Assignment 4.  
It provides an interactive Shiny app to explore the relationship between **Fire Weather Index (FWI)** and **burned area** in south-eastern Australia.

### 🔹 For Users (Recommended)

Install and run the Bushfire Explorer app like a normal R package:

```r
# 1) Install helper once
install.packages("remotes")

# 2) Install this package from GitHub
remotes::install_github("ETC5523-2025/assignment-4-packages-and-shiny-apps-quanyu-qian")

# 3) Load and run
library(quanyu)
run_app()
```

### 🧑 For Developers / Local Development (optional)

Use this mode if you are contributing or testing the package source code.

```r
# Load the package in development mode (without installing)
devtools::load_all()

# Launch the interactive Bushfire Explorer app
quanyu::run_app()

```
Once loaded, you can explore the relationship between **fire weather index (FWI)** and **burned area** interactively through the Bushfire Explorer Shiny app.

## 🚀 Package Features

This package contains the following components:

| Component | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **`se_fire_monthly`** | A **simulated tidy dataset** (100 rows) containing **Fire Weather Index (FWI)**, burned area, and month. *(Generated in `data-raw/make_data.R` for demonstration purposes.)* |
| **`run_app()`** | A Shiny app that visualises the relationship between FWI and log(burned area) with filters for month and minimum FWI. |
| **Vignette** | Describes how the dataset was generated, documented, and visualized in the Shiny app vignette. |
| **`inst/app/www/style.css`** | Provides custom CSS styling for the Shiny interface. |
