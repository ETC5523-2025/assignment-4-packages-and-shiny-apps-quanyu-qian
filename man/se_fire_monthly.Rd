\title{Monthly Fire Weather and Burned Area Data (Simulated)}
\format{
A data frame with 100 rows and 3 variables:
\describe{
\item{month}{Month of observation (Jan–Dec).}
\item{FWI}{Fire Weather Index (higher = more dangerous fire conditions).}
\item{burned_area}{Area burned (hectares, plotted as \code{log10(burned_area)}).}
}
}
\source{
Simulated data generated by Quanyu Qian (2025) in \code{data-raw/make_data.R}.
}
\usage{
se_fire_monthly
}
\description{
A simulated dataset created for the Bushfire Explorer app.
It mimics the relationship between Fire Weather Index (FWI) and
burned area in bushfire events across different months.
}
\details{
The data are generated in \code{data-raw/make_data.R} for demonstration
purposes — not from real records — and are used in the Shiny app
to explore how higher FWI values are associated with larger burned areas.
