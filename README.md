# quanyu

**quanyu** is an R package developed for **ETC5523 Assignment 4**.  
It provides a small demo dataset and a Shiny app that allows users to
interactively explore the relationship between **Fire Weather Index
(FWI)** and **burned area** across months.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ðŸ§  Background

This package was built upon the earlier assignments in ETC5523, where
ERA5 and MODIS datasets were used to study Australian bushfire
conditions.  
In this simplified version, we include a synthetic dataset
`se_fire_monthly` (12 monthly observations) that mimics the relationship
between FWI and burned area.  
The dataset was created using the script in `data-raw/make_data.R`.

## ðŸ§© Installation

This is a demonstration package created for ETC5523 Assignment 4.

You can load it locally in RStudio after building the package.
